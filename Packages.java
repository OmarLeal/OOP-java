     * JAVA PACKAGES & API
     * 
     * A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

     - Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
     - User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
    
     Built-in Packages

     import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
     import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
     
     ImportClass.java
     ImportPackage.java
    
     User-defined Packages
    
     Its just a folder. We can create a package just using the word "package [myPackage]"
     MyPackageClass.java
